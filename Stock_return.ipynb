    "\n",
    "In this project, I plan to use machine learning to construct an asset pricing model. In the model, I will have a set of variables to capture the features of stock returns. The problem naturally is categorized into two sub-tasks: the choice of the most important features and the prediction of the stock returns. We will separate our data into the training and testing sets, which are totally separated in the task. We will first train the data using all input variables available, then we select the most important k variables based on the prediction. Then we truncate the number variables to k to redo the prediction. To improve the robustness of our method, we will test our full-variable and truncated-variable models using the testing set, and apply four-fold cross-validation to run the model multiple times. Besides, according to the reference (Gu et al., 2019), we may use a new methodology here, which includes the statistical model describing the risk premium, an  objective function to estimate model parameters and computational algorithms. The methods we will use include but not limited to simple linear regression, regularized linear regressions (e.g. ridge regression), boosted regression tree, random forests and neural networks. For input space dimension reduction, we can use partial linear square (PLS) and principal component regression (PCR). All of the estimates share the basic goal of minimum MSE. The final result of this project includes the regression accuracy, the most important input variables of each method."
